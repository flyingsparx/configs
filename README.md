configs
=================

A collection of personal configuration files that aren't typically synced across machines otherwise.

**Currently includes**:
* `vimrc`
    * Config for vim (though still very basic for the moment)
    * Dir: `~/vimrc`
* `tmux.conf`
    * Config for tmux
    * Adapted from [tony's](https://github.com/tony/tmux-config)
    * Dir: `~/.tmux.conf`
